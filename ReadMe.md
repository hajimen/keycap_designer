# keycap-designer

**keycap-designer** is a Python-based open-source application to design keycap printing images.
[DecentKeyboards](https://www.etsy.com/shop/DecentKeyboards) accepts the artifacts
as complete printing-ready data.

keycap-designer is good for designing keycap sets. A keycap set should have a consistent design across its keycaps.
keycap-designer helps a lot to make a consistent design.
So the learning curve may be too steep if you need just one or two keycaps. In that case, please send me the
printing image file, without struggling keycap-designer.

keycap-designer requires some knowledge of Python. It makes the artifact from a Python script that you write.
Look at `content/tutorial_1.py`, `content/tutorial_2.py`, and `content/tutorial_3.py`.

keycap-designer assumes that all keycaps are white. No colored keycaps. (But you can make alike ones with
Junana profile keycaps.)

## Requirements

- Windows PC or Mac

You can manage to do with other OS, but it will be harder than you are guessing now, I guess.

- Python 3.11

Windows: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Mac: I recommend [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its
[Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

- [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/jp/reader/)

## Supported profiles and sizes

keycap-designer supports **XDA** and **Junana** profiles.

### XDA

The name "XDA" is not very precise. In keycap-designer, "XDA" is 9.5 mm height. Some shops say 9.3 or 9.2 mm.
They are identical.

keycap-designer supports:

- 1u
- 1.25u
- 1.5u
- 1.75u
- 2u
- 2.25u
- 2.75u

And can do front-side printing with 1u.

### Junana

Junana is a brand new profile from DecentKeyboards.

- designed for 17mm key pitch, can do with 19mm
- compatible with MX, Kailh Choc v2, and Gateron Low Profile switches
- Both convex and concave are available for all sizes
- can print seamlessly on the all sides

The size variations are:

- 1u
- 1.5u
- 2.25u

**CAUTION**: The unit of Junana is 17mm. The 2.25u is almost equivalent to 2u of 19mm pitch.

## How to start

1. Download the latest ZIP file for your machine from [https://github.com/hajimen/keycap-designer/releases]
and extract to somewhere you like.
2. Launch `edit.bat` or `edit.sh`. It should open VSCode.
3. Launch `app.bat` or `app.sh` in the VSCode terminal.
4. From VSCode explorer, open `content/tutorial_1.py`. This is a content script.
5. In the app, run `load tutorial_1.py`. It should show a preview PDF.
6. Compare the preview PDF with `tutorial_1.py`.
7. Modify somewhere of the script, close the preview PDF, and in the app, hit Enter key. It should show new preview.
8. Repeat modify-close-preview and grab the way.

## Content script: At a glance

```python
from keycap_designer.manuscript import *


def generate():
    TEST_IMAGE = here() / 'test_image.png'
    # here() returns a pathlib.Path object representing the directory which contains the caller's source file.
    # In other words, 'test_image.png' should be in the same directory with this file.

    m_mandatory = Profile('XDA') @ Specifier('1u')
    # Profile and Specifier objects are the mandatory Descriptor objects.
    # By combining Descriptor objects with @ operator, a Manuscript object is made.

    # About Specifier:
    # 1.5 unit (Tab key) is '15u', no period between 1 and 5.
    # Bump key is 'Homing 1u'.

    m_image = m_mandatory @ TopImage(TEST_IMAGE)
    # TopImage() returns a Descriptor object which represents a printing image and the printing side.
    # You can combine a Manuscript object with a Descriptor object by @ operator and make a Manuscript object.

    return [m_image]


CONTENT = generate()  # CONTENT will be imported from the app.
```

## How to order custom keycaps

### Dependencies

`cmm` module in the dependencies requires a special attention. It is not on PyPI.
See [https://github.com/hajimen/cmm]. Run `pip install cmm-*.whl` first if you prepare
venv by yourself.

### Keycap profile

You can inject your `keycap_designer.profile.Profile` object to `keycap_designer.profile.PROFILES`.
Mimic `keycap_designer.profile.xda`.

Do you need deform correction like Junana profile? It is quite hard. Good luck.

### Packaging

Prepare venv by yourself.
Run `pip install pyinstaller`, and from repository root directory,
Windows: `packaging/win.bat`, macOS: `sh packaging/osx.sh`.
The artifact should found in `./dist` directory.

### Version

`keycap_designer/_version.py` will be generated by `python -m build --wheel`.

### Unit test

`pip install pdf2image`.

Download [poppler-windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows) latest binary release,
extract `poppler-*` to `./tests` directory, and rename the `poppler-*` to `poppler`.
